/**
 * sidestep.ts - Merkle sidestep proofs, version 3 (spec section 6).
 *
 * A sidestep crosses an LCA boundary with a Merkle hash tree instead of a
 * Cantor pairing tree. SHA-256 is fixed-size, so there is no storage
 * bottleneck: the cost of a sidestep is purely time (2^(h+1) - 1 hashes per
 * crossing axis). It exists to cross the walls that Cantor computation
 * cannot, at heights where intermediate pairing values would not fit in any
 * machine.
 *
 * Version 2 (spec 6.15) makes the sidestep a toll. Every leaf is seeded with
 * the mover's previous event id and the axis (6.4), so the tree is unique to
 * one chain position and nobody's published proof shortens anyone else's
 * crossing. With no canonical root left to compare against, the prover also
 * publishes openings (6.10): the destination leaf's path and eight more at
 * sampled positions, which a verifier recomputes from scratch. The seed
 * prefix is exactly one SHA-256 block, so its compression state is taken once
 * per axis and every leaf costs one compression, as before (6.5).
 *
 * Version 3 (spec 6.16) puts a price on the samples. Under version 2 they
 * came from the root, so a prover that built part of a tree could change one
 * fabricated node and draw fresh samples for about h hashes, until they all
 * missed the part it skipped. Now they come from G, a hash over a nonce and
 * the three roots that must fall below 2^256 / A, where A is the crossing's
 * leaves over eight: a fresh set of samples costs one eighth of the tree, the
 * smallest price at which skipping work never pays (6.11). The nonce is
 * published in the `mn` tag.
 *
 * Checked against the spec's sidestep-reference.py golden vectors.
